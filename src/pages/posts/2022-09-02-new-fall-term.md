New members are always welcome to join at the beginning of any new term! Please email the choir at sumchoir@gmail.com to join our member email list and receive a registration form, or with any questions about joining.

We rehearse Tuesdays from 7pm - 9pm at Trinity United Church, 40 Spring St., Summerside.

[Krista's 2021 Welcome Message](https://www.summersidechoir.ca/posts/2021-09-07-back-at-it/) still applies, and please join us in welcoming her for her first term, again!
